Progress Log #0: 23/06/2023

I have so far managed to set up the git repo for the project and I have also began to look at what
python library would be best for analysing fit files. A quick chatGPT query identified fitparse
to be a suitable library, one that breaks each part of data into a record that can then be broken
down even further into more individual components.

There have been a few discrepencies I have noticed thus far, such as some random timestamp values
that are stored but are from an hour or so before the actual activity that is stored in the file.
I will need to continue to find the most optimal way to parse this file and then set it up for 
analysis, probably using pandas or numpy for efficiency.

Watched a "Programming with Mosh" tutorial that was over an hour explaining how to set up a react app,
and a few of the basics to go along with it. Will be helpful knowledge down the line hopefully!

Managed to parse the .fit file a bit more again but not made a great deal of progress.
