I have so far managed to set up the git repo for the project and I have also began to look at what
python library would be best for analysing fit files. A quick chatGPT query identified fitparse
to be a suitable library, one that breaks each part of data into a record that can then be broken
down even further into more individual components.

There have been a few discrepencies I have noticed thus far, such as some random timestamp values
that are stored but are from an hour or so before the actual activity that is stored in the file.
I will need to continue to find the most optimal way to parse this file and then set it up for 
analysis, probably using pandas or numpy for efficiency.

Watched a "Programming with Mosh" tutorial that was over an hour explaining how to set up a react app,
and a few of the basics to go along with it. Will be helpful knowledge down the line hopefully!

Managed to parse the .fit file a bit more again but not made a great deal of progress.

Progress Log #2: 01/07/23

Been probably to long since I last spent a bit of time to look at this stuff, but I have now successfully
made a start on the react app and managed to create a couple of dummy components to display when the app
is set to run.

I have also briefly had a look at what would be the best option for hosting some sort of backend service
for the app, and I think I have decided on FastAPI as this is what was ultimately used in the team project
last semester so it will be good to have some real code to look at for hints and guidance. Just for simple 
python scripts to be run, but it could be good to have for down the line if I ever create a file upload
system that then subsequently stores the files on an online database, but may be getting a bit ahead of myself
with that one! Still a lot of learning to be done and I have to keep focussed even if it is just small
steps at a time.

Another update later in the day! Managed to make some moves with the FastAPI setup and I can now use the 
functions that I created earlier to parse an uploaded file on their docs page!

Am I actually getting anywhere? That is the question. Been watching more videos trying to work out how to
upload a file through react to axios, and I feel like I'm close but still struggling to fully understand
the concepts I am working with. The last blast of code that I used at the end was mostly produced by 
good old chatGPT, and I am trying to read through it and understand more but there is definitely still
a long way to go.
